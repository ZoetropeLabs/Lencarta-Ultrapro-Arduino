 This example demonstrates half-\/rate transfer using the F\+I\+F\+O buffers~\newline


It is an example of how to use the \hyperlink{class_r_f24}{R\+F24} class. Write this sketch to two different nodes. Put one of the nodes into 'transmit' mode by connecting ~\newline
 with the serial monitor and sending a 'T'. The data transfer will begin, with the receiver displaying the payload count. (32\+Byte Payloads) ~\newline
