This example continues to make use of all the normal functionality of the radios including the auto-\/ack and auto-\/retry features, but allows ack-\/payloads to be written optionlly as well. ~\newline
 This allows very fast call-\/response communication, with the responding radio never having to switch out of Primary Receiver mode to send back a payload, but having the option to switch to ~\newline
 primary transmitter if wanting to initiate communication instead of respond to a commmunication.
