 This example demonstrates the use of and extended timeout period and auto-\/retries/auto-\/re\+Use to increase reliability in noisy or low signal scenarios. ~\newline


Write this sketch to two different nodes. Put one of the nodes into 'transmit' mode by connecting with the serial monitor and sending a 'T'. The data ~\newline
